                 <p>Chinese fried rice made with fragrant jasmine rice, carrots, peas, and scrambled eggs. This easy stir-fried dish turns plain white rice into flavorful grains lightly seasoned with soy sauce and tossed with colorful vegetables. I often use leftover rice for a quick and convenient meal.</p>

                <p>Fried rice is a Chinese food restaurant staple that’s always on the take-out menu. It’s hard not to eat every light and fluffy morsel. What makes the dish so tasty is the stir-fry technique that’s easy to tackle at home. Using this vegetarian recipe as a base, you can incorporate any mix-in’s or proteins you’d like to switch up the taste.
                Growing up in a big Chinese family not far from Oakland Chinatown, homemade fried rice at our house was a “clean-out-the-fridge” type dish, no recipe needed. My mom would use leftover rice from a previous meal and then add in some meat like diced ham, spam or char siu. Easy and delicious every time.
